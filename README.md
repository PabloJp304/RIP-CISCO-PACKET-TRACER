# RIP Protocol Implementation with Cisco Packet Tracer

In this project, the implementation of a Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is carried out using the Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation platform.

# Project highlights include:

- Device Configuration: Network devices, such as routers and switches, are configured using Cisco Packet Tracer to represent a realistic network topology.

- RIP Protocol Configuration: RIP Protocol parameters are set on the network routers, including enabling RIP protocol on relevant interfaces and configuring routing metrics.

- Analysis and Testing: A thorough analysis of the operation of the RIP Protocol on the simulated network is performed, including verification of the routing table and propagation of RIP updates between routers.

- Troubleshooting: Potential problems and challenges that may arise during the configuration and implementation of the RIP Protocol are addressed using Cisco Packet Tracer diagnostic and troubleshooting tools.

- Documentation and Evaluation: The RIP Protocol configuration and testing process is documented in detail, along with the results obtained during the simulation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the protocol in the simulated network is evaluated.
